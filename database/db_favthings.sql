(1, '1984.jpg', '1984, George Orwell', '\"War is peace.Freedom is slavery.Ignorance is strength.\"', 'A Novel, often published as 1984, is a dystopian novel by English novelist George Orwell. It was published in June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell\'s ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. The story was mostly written at Barnhill, a farmhouse on the Scottish island of Jura, at times while Orwell suffered from severe tuberculosis. Thematically, Nineteen Eighty-Four centers on the risks of government overreach, totalitarianism, and repressive regimentation of all persons and behaviors within society'),
(2, 'great.jpg', 'The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald ', '\"The world only exists in your eyes.You can make it as big or as small as you want.\"', 'The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional towns of West Egg and East Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession with the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald\'s magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval and excess, creating a portrait of the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream.'),
(3, 'ulysses.jpg', 'Ulysses, James Joyce', '\"Shut your eyes and see.\"', 'Ulysses is a modernist novel by Irish writer James Joyce. It was first serialized in parts in the American journal The Little Review from March 1918 to December 1920 and then published in its entirety in Paris by Sylvia Beach on 2 February 1922, Joyce\'s 40th birthday. It is considered to be one of the most important works of modernist literature and has been called \"a demonstration and summation of the entire movement.\" According to Declan Kiberd, \"Before Joyce, no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking\"');
